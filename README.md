Hi there, 

My name is Jonathan, and I'm a UCSF MD/MAS student. I'm interested in how we can apply machine learning/AI to improve predictive models and surgical care. 

Here is the link to my [DataSci 223 Assignment 1](https://github.com/pojonli/datasci_223/blob/main/exercises/1-foundations/exercise.ipynb)

Still getting familiar with the structure of GitHub for this first assignment. Other than that, I hope to get more practice with Python and some hands-on experience with Generative AI, LLPs, and thinking about their applications to medicine.
